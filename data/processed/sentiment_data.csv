"i was cured of ever buying another iwatch.  there is zero chance i buy another.<br><br>all you have to do to be cured - update the software.  when it pairs, takes 10 hours, then says it cannot pair, then you have to reset your watch, then try to do it again and again and again - you will never buy another iwatch.<br><br>it&#39;s apprent apple does not test their software and make sure these things do not get stuck and when they do - it fixes it along the way or picks up where it left off.  it&#39;s absurd what you have to do to try and get it updated.  i finally gave up and sold it.  every time i see a one - i think of the pain and nightmare of the truly horrible device.  <br><br>do you want to see your heart rate rise?  update the software.  how it&#39;s this bad is just shocking.",0
"after having an apple watch for nearly a year, i just don&#39;t like smart watches. makes no sense when you have an iphone and just never used it and charging it every day or two is the worst.",0
just picked up a open box 46mm series 10 with cellular on ebay for $359. saved $200,1
yeah this is about as bad as those airpod max 2. little upgrades.,0
i feel apple needs to remove the crown from  its watches as most of its functions can be done by a combination touchscreen already and a button,2
"i actually lucked out. i was looking for a used watch and found a 5 for 1000kr but then found a 7 also used for 1200kr, but that guy ghosted me, so i waited for january sale and bought a 9 on sale for 1600kr. they ran out of stock and gave me a 10 instead for the same price. first one so very excited!",1

you are excellent. thank you for informiing before the purchase.,1
"bought the series 10 even i have series 9. all i wanted is slimmer design with jet black and lte needed anyways this year. luckily i can sell series 9 with good price, so gap between update is minimal too. besides, if you compare series 9 and 10, they are quite different in terms of physical shape, despite their internal is similar.",1

it looks kinda cool but i dont get why one would buy this unless they&#39;re super into fitness. i dont want another device reminding me of my emails and it looks so difficult to type using that watch. i prefer classic watches which dont add to the screen-fatigue,1

still confused why a watch with an 18 hour battery appeals to so many people.,0
honestly... what evolutional can a watch really have? what else can they really add to the watch?,2
battery life. not buying another apple watch while it needs charging every day. i charge my garmin once a week.,2
no battery life improvement = no interest.,1
"my last watch was a series 4, so due to upgrade and i love the series 10. <br><br>personally i think the shape is perfect, i don&#39;t really want anything about the design to change.",1

"upgrading from series 3. so this is a big deal for me, lol.",1
i can always count on you for tech reviews. especially with apple.,2
what if one has never owned an apple watch? is ten a good place to start,1
"the average life span of an apple watch is 2 to 5 years. each new iteration costs more than the last. a wrist watch can last 20 years or more. a smart watch provides no value that we did not already derive from pre-existing tech. i am amazed at how the general public has welomed this tech with open arms. it shows how easily the general public are influenced in their consumerism. corporations have to invent new tech to keep you spending your money and this is simply why this tech exists and why each iteration will continue to be pumped out and keep the public locked on the upgrade hamster wheel. i hate smart watches. i detest everything about them and what they represent. it is  step closer to be fully integrated with the digital reality(which isn&#39;t reality). for those who have been conditioned to believe you need this tech, try and go a week without it on your wrist. can you do it? does the idea fill you with anxiety? if so, then you have been brainwashed to think you need it, that you cant live without it. go a step further. leave your phone at home just for a day, on a work day. see what happens.",1
how battery life ?,2
series 10 = larger display and still prone to scratches at this price point?,2
what is that bracelet with the numbers on it? where can i get one?,2
still sporting the series 6!,2
"i know its a long shot but i hope apple consider a large, like invicta size, round version. i would more likely get one. not a fan of the square shape.",1
i will not buy something to tell the time when i need to stress all the charging. apple and battery = bad,0

which color watch band is that? is that ink?,2
don&#39;t love the apple watch. it&#39;s mildly useful. but not a great sleep or fitness tracker.,1
"alright listen up. majority of people on this planet don&#39;t have the money or luxury to upgrade watches/phones etc. every single year. if you&#39;re someone who&#39;s wanting to get the series 10 after already owning a series 8 or 9 then you&#39;re either too spoilt or have too much money. this guy gets paid to make youtube videos and compare current model with previous model. you on the other hand can barely afford your mortgage repayments. don&#39;t get this watch if you&#39;ve already got a series 7-8-9. if you have a series 6 or prior, then get it. easy. simple.",1
"you know what would be cool, if apple came out with a round face version just saying if they did that i would then consider an upgrade otherwise no point really upgrading your apple watch !",1
@marques i still have the series 4 so do you think i should upgrade not just to the 10 but just do an upgrade?,2
"been rokcing the 8 for two years now, and i&#39;m sticking to it...",2
brot he water part got me,2
"i really adore watches.. i have always owned an apple watch. but i feel buyers remorse over my stainless steel version. comparing it to my automatic and even quartz watches, it doesn&#39;t have any significants, and the design has become very stale.",0
is that is very good apple 10 let me know this good or not because i buy new one on my way,1
"if you dont have a watch at all which one would you get? 8,9, or 10.",2
it&#39;s also <b>doesn&#39;t</b> have the blood oxygen sensing that my series 7 does. guess i&#39;m keeping this one lol.,1
this guy is so scared to be critical of apple products. waste reviews,0
"i am receiving notifications on my watch only if my cell phone is locked. if i am using my cell phone, the notification no longer arrives on the watch?",0
"i feel like the apple watch series 10 is not as high value of a product as the iphone. when you ask someone what watch are you using and they respond with apple watch, no one really asks any further questions. we already know it&#39;s the most popular watch on users wrists, especially the ones of  iphone users. you slap it on your rist and you go about your day.  the only people who care about the looks of the watch are the tech savvy individuals, the ones who are disproportionately outnumbered by the number of people who do not care, which is a lot. i picked up an apple watch series 10 because i was upgrading for my series 5. i&#39;m not upgrading for new features. i&#39;m upgrading because my apple watch series 5 broke. i don&#39;t even think that watch should&#39;ve been excluded from software updates. my mom had an apple watch series 7 and she upgraded to the series 10 as she wanted to treat herself. as a person who is very much in love with the apple ecosystem, i don&#39;t really care that much about the apple watch. i don&#39;t think most people care either. it&#39;s just a watch. it tells the time and does some other stuff as well. that&#39;s really all people need. and i think apple understands that. that&#39;s why they did not upgrade the apple watch drastically. they just made it thinner. they know most people really don&#39;t care what the apple watch looks like.",1

it genuinely irks me that they haven&#39;t changed the watch to match the design of the iphones &amp; ipads. both of which have been on the flatter design for 4 years now. at least the ultra has a flat screen. i honestly don&#39;t understand why apple hasn&#39;t changed it.,1

what about blood oxygen sensor,2
the apple sheep will never see further than they are told to see....lol...there are much better watches out there,1
"there&#39;s not much they can do with the watch in terms of design - either square, rectangular, or circular. they can make it thinner...they could flatten the edge. the main thing they could do is add more tech to it. for me i wish it could work with other phones and not just iphone...it would be awesome if it could fully work on it&#39;s own and never need a phone. personally for me it&#39;s the apps - it just feels very weak still and there&#39;s not a lot of useful apps for the average person.<br>if they were to do a redesign though the risk is the bands... it&#39;s bad enough when they make minor adjustments to phones that then require a brand new case - imagine having to replace all your straps",0

does the lack of spo2 metering not concern you?   i for one want it and thus will stick with my series 8.,0
the best review you could ever do: and this feels like apple&#39;s big statement of &#39;this is the apple watch.&#39; take it or leave it.,1
mosciski flats,2
"i think the next big think, or important thing is still about the health sensors. more very important parameters like blood pressure and continuous monitoring. both thing is very important. so far apple just scratched the surface, barely helping the user. i hope in 10 years smart watches could monitor continuously (in every seconds) the blood pressure and the ecg too).",1
delores parks,2
hey speaks my language. i am so disappointed with apple. thinking about switching.,0
can we talk about how terribly well the skip ahead feature is implemented? google really hit the nail on the head with that one to fuck with creators,0
this is not a technical review!!,2
i&#39;m still hanging on series 3,2
judson parks,2
so if you were looking to upgrade out of iphone which one would you recommend,1
which one would you suggest the series 10 or ultra 2,2
where is your review of the pixel watch 3??,2
you could take your rubber band bracelet off when reviewing the watch since its about the watch. distracting,0
i thought apple was coming out with a men&#39;s watch for the series 10??,2
temperature detector is cool for outdoor pool,1
"hi marques, i&#39;m brazilian and a big fan of yours. i really wish you would create a channel in portuguese",1
is it worth swapping the 5 series?,1
not big upgrades but shamefully still the best selling watch in the world,1
series 7 here may be my last apple watch,2
battery life is still less than 1 day :),1
"i dont get why some people are upset. thats the technology that we have and its nearly impossible to fit more in that tiny space. garmin watches last way more cause (1) they&#39;re bigger (2) they&#39;re not nearly as capable as the watch in most aspects and (3) they&#39;re specifically designed to last a long time since people who use them buys them to do sport. the apple watch is like a mini phone with health and sport features. the battery is not bad considering the amount of things it can do, at the speed it does them and given the battery capacity. at this point, the only thing i need from the watch is a 7 day week battery and i don&#39;t think we&#39;re seeing that until like 2040 or 2050 when a new battery technology is released (if its ever released lol)",1
y no ai in apple watch series 10. i was hoping for that. i think i will wait for series 11.,1
lewis robert davis sandra hall jessica,2
this is the apple watch of all time. meh.,0
"i feel that what&#39;s letf of apple, is just the name the brand has made...",2
"honestly, nothing new about this makes me wanna upgrade. the fast charging on the s9 is sufficient for my needs.",1
what kind of wristband you wearing??,2
so does that mean the watch 10 screen is better than the ultra 2 screen?,1
don&#39;t be that guy lol please don&#39;t.,1
i got it because rose gold finally came back.,2

please mkbhd use your platform to shine light on gaza. please. all tech channels are gradually covering it. please help the people of gaza. they need you.,1
i still running s4 :(,0
out of 8 minutes video 2 minutes are for an ad. really i think marquees spend more time on the review than apple spent on thinking of the upgrade.,2
the battery life on all apple watch models is truly hilarious.,1
"man, i just need to know where you get those straps from? need to see if its available for the series 7",2
it&#39;s a big upgrade compared to my old a$$ fit bit.,1
"for some reason, while viewing at a distance, it feels like a cheaply made third-party copy of the real apple smartwatch",1
"wild swimming in scotland in both lochs and the sea, it would actually be really quite interesting to see the different temperatures between them :d",1

thinnest apple watch ever?!,2
what&#39;s the difference on the serie 8 vs 9 vs 10 in regard od siri and on device possibilities  ??,2

i love my series 10! was upgraded from series 4. it&#39;s amazing,1
fabulous review. i was actually looking to buy this but now will go with 9 series.,1
"still got series 3, stop wasting your money",0
9448 nienow turnpike,2
i have an apple watch series 3. struggling to choose between a cheaper series 9 or a newer series 10.,0
apple definitely keeps an eye on these reviews so they know everyone was expecting a redesign of the series 10. they will probably do that for the series 11.,1
"thanks for critical review! apple really needs to step up their innovation. they&#39;re just sucking money on fan base without any serious, innovation that&#39;s all.",1
"mkbhd reviews are becoming more and more useless. never speaking about the big minuses, he knows where the views/money come from. if someone wants an honest review, go watch techtablets.",2
my series 7 still works good...im on the fence if i should upgrade...i might do it just cause you said i should though,2
the speaker and the screen/larger screen size is significant. really liking mine so far.,1
so are they thinking out of the box for the future? like off the wrist? or more sci-fi? if this is the redesign.,1
"i upgraded from my 9 only because best buy gave me $300 in trade in. otherwise, yeah.",1
"i came from a series 6, and it&#39;s a big upgrade for me, but other people wouldn&#39;t notice it as much. but i&#39;m happy, knowing i have the current latest version :-)",1
"i just feel that this apple watch is similar to the iphone 7 launch: refined past design, the same special color and this is the device launched 10 years after the first iteration. iphone x was launched almost 11 years after iphone 2g.",1
what did you expect? a triangle shape watch? don&#39;t understand this desire to fix something that works.,1
"i&#39;m curious how it measures my sleep apnea, which is in the moderate level.",1
"i pre ordered my apple watch series 10, arriving on the 23rd of september, excited for my silver with pure platinum nike watch band!",1
apple watch needs a longer battery lifetime.. not faster charging!,2
terpaling apple watch.,2
anything happening with the sleep tracking app being able to record afternoon naps?  i thought that was getting added.,2

"i&#39;m coming from a series 6, so it&#39;s gonna be a big one for me.",2
first time getting the aluminum apple watch just because of the beautiful black color! skipping the iphone 16 sticking with iphone 15 pro max 1 tb.,1
should i upgrade my series 5 to this one?,2
apple fans got played again this year. brainwashed marketing is crazy. good thing review king is a realist,1
"bro., how about apple watch ultra 2 black titanium?",2
what about battery life ?,2
is it scratch resistant or just like jetblack iphone 7?,1
watching it on my s9,2
i just realised you&#39;ve still not done a review of the whoop..,2
good to know that &quot;this guys&quot; exists all over the world ffs,0
does the alway on second hands works on the ultra 2?,2
"apple, keep pushing these redesigned incremental updates, so i can afford the previous series",2
"so now, aw 10 or aw ultra 2?",2
i&#39;m still on my series 4 that has not skipped a beat. 6 years is a really awesome time for a smart watch imo that has not slowed down at all. i wil lhowever be looking into updating this year mostly due to all the new sensors introduced since series 5 - 10.,1
apple copied extra line of text from google&#39;s recent pixel watch 3,2
pov : next apple watch have a tracking  pad(camera controls iphone 16),2
technology is at the point where you can&#39;t have huge changes every year in phone/watches/earphones anymore. <br>so the companies are riding that ai wave and it&#39;s very sad that ai is becoming everyone&#39;s focus instead of polishing previous mistakes in their devices.,0
hi. is it worth it upgrading to s10 from se2?,1
the thing about the apple watch is that they got it perfect pretty much the first time.. the only thing they&#39;re doing is fitting better/faster shit in the thing better..,1
i just want a more circular apple watch design man,1
how do you have it already?,2
"what a shame that apple watches series  6-7-8  have blood oxygen monitor and in the 9-10 and ultra series no... why?<a href=""uckszu2wh9gy1mb0dv-11ujg/2sify8vig8z96alulydqdq""></a>",0
is a screen protector recommended?,1
what is the significance of your wrist band with the numbers on it? i know something to do with tech right?,1
i like the watch for its fitness benefits. but i also dislike having to wear a flat screen on my wrist already. now the size increases are making it worse.,0
picking mine up on saturday,2
apple was very lazy in these updates on the watch n iphone. no innovation in years. tim cook needs to step down since he is all about profits and now cant even do that since apple stock is dropping.,1
don&#39;t be that guy,2
bottom line:<br>stick with whatever apple watch/iphone you are currently using.,2
what kind of features/improvements would you like to see on the apple watch,1
looks like not much has changed since my series 6.,1
"thanks for the vid! sadly hoped for a design change this year, yikes",1
i&#39;m not watching this. can someone reply to this and let me know if i can watch tiktoks and youtube poops on this? if not i&#39;m not getting it.,2
"the apple watch s13 will have same design but smaller bezels than the s10. literally any apple watch you buy now is going to be good unless they whip out bac reading, heart rate monitor, multiple days of battery life",1
even if i have it for free i don wear it,1
"so after masimo successfully won an injuction against apple activating the blood oxygen sensor in series 9 watches, and its ceo said he&#39;s open to a licensing deal if apple ever reaches out, i assumed apple had an alternative solution up its sleeves. that either it had a novel way to gauge blood oxygen without violating masimo&#39;s ip, or that it was finally willing to work out a licensing deal for series 10.<br><br>instead, no word on fate of that sensor in series 10? do we just assume it&#39;s gone and this new apple watch introduces no new sensors?",1
apple didn&#39;t use anything different really . looks like apple hit a wall,1
love the new s9 sip lol,1
"yea, it&#39;s a bit underwhelming but i&#39;m still rocking the aw5 so i&#39;ll be upgrading to the 10.",2
not enough to upgrade from my series 7,2
buy one phone. use it for a decade.period,2
the ultra 2 can plss as t music from the speakers too with the update,2
i&#39;m waiting for the rumored blood pressure sensor.,0
zzzzzzzzzzzz,2
garcia betty jones kevin brown kimberly,2
"i actually like the fact that the watch has speakers now. i can listen to podcasts while cooking or doing housework :d also the bigger screen, new black glossy finish and that it charges even faster and is slimmer. for me its the first apple watch. i will return my series 9 i just got and exchange for the 10",1
im still vibing with my series 3,2
i was eyeing the stainless steel for a long time and a few months ago while 9 was out i bought the 8 stainless steel 45mm at a good price.  best buy ever,1
the 1hz frequenzy is actually pretty cool for having always on displays<br>but that alone wont replace my current version lol,1
i ordered mine. coming on 20th sept,2
surprised marques didn&#39;t mention the ultra 2&#39;s new black color. :/,0
lol like why i need a speaker on my watch????????? the music quality is so crap i would rather listen music through my headphone,1
"i have the series 6, and truly feel no need to upgrade, doesn&#39;t seem like much has changed besides screen size.",1
"first time hearing the word &quot;squircle&quot; so thank you for that.  this will be my first apple watch since series 3 so i&#39;m pretty excited. i think we&#39;re reaching an age in all of tech where major redesigns can only go so far. i do prefer an &quot;if it ain&#39;t broke&quot; approach to design. i also appreciate backward compatibility on previous watch bands.<br><br>i do enjoy your clear, concise, to-the-point reviews. thanks!",1
so i have a 7 and was thinking of getting a new watch so is 10 the right move,2
"unless they give me a week of battery life, i&#39;ll stick with my garmin. i can live without the extra bells and whistles but not a 1-2 day battery life.",2
hello! why do i get redness and itching after wearing an apple watch for prolonged periods. it makes it almost impossible for me to wear it for sleep tracking. what could it be? how do i mitigate this?,2
is the apple watch 10 going to have the new ai siri?,2
the year it becomes a circle is the year i stop buying it.,0
perez elizabeth garcia kimberly anderson michelle,2
0673 karelle roads,2
"dear tim cook, why is the most expensive apple watch now inferior to the cheaper series 10? why would apple not put the very latest chip in the ultra 2? why would the ultra 2 not have the new screen (better viewing angles etc)? why is the series 10 more ultra than the ultra? why spend almost double the money on an ultra 2 when you can have more watch for half the price in a series 10? kindest regards from an apple fan boy.",1
i like your t-shirt,1
"feels like these smartwatches still haven&#39;t conquered the #1 issue that people care about: battery life.  garmin and others (fitbit pre-google) clearly had this figured out, but for some reason, apple hasn&#39;t decided to do a ground-up redesign of watchos to get the battery where it should be.  with google&#39;s watchos it&#39;s at least pretty obvious what the problem is, they&#39;re running a variant of full-blown android on the watch, which is crazy power hungry considering what you want a watch to do!",1
waiting for iwatch 11 (currently 5). waiting for iphone 17 (currently 12). it&#39;s just not worth upgrading at the moment.,0
"apple has been very consistent with the design updates of the watch. same design with sharp corners from series 0 to series 3. made it bigger and rounding the corners with series 4, increasing the display size on series 7. and now either series 10, they increased the size again. but also the bezel is a little thicker than before, so my guess is that with series 13 they will feature a bezel size more similar to the series 7 again.",1
rolex sud has not had a major redesign since 1950s. why should good design change? incremental is good. products that have longevity - good!,1
"disappointing update from the serie 9 but for someone like me that is fully jumping from google pixel to apple iphone, that will do it :)",1
i feel tim is starting to troll us now,2
i hate how my galaxy watch&#39;s battery lasts only 2 days and i often have it run out of battery during the night while tracking my sleep. it&#39;s the main reason i&#39;ll never get a galaxy watch again. i was shocked to hear apple can only do less than a day?!?! wtf,0
"so for someone who has never had an apple watch, which one would be the best bang for the buck?",1
boring watch. make it round please.,2
leave it to this guy to make an ad interesting (sleep thing mid-roll),1
ye apple ka itna kyu chusta he kala,2
me waiting for an actual review: this is it?,2
lewis jeffrey martin melissa lopez daniel,2
8sleep seems like a very scammy brand. there are literally no real reviews online about this product.,1
can apple watch detect sleep paralysis?,2
10 is just a round number,1
just bought my 10,2
your voice sounds a bit more echoey than normal. new recording hardware? nice work on the review!,1
i like to see apple mixing it up.  <br><br>instead of samsung and apple just back-n-forth copying each other. they&#39;ve thrown pixel products into the mix!!,1
"for me personally, i like when there isn&#39;t massive redesigns of things, i don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessary. <br><br>i think if you&#39;re a reviewer and you get all the new stuff every single year then maybe it gets old and makes your job harder, but for us everyday plebs something having a solid design and it being improved on, even slightly, every year leads to something really well fleshed out when you upgrade after 3+ years.",1
keeping my series 8 until the battery dies completely.,2
slow evolutionary micro changes. not revolutionary. i will stick to my first generation ultra. <br>tra.,2
weimann valley,2
mkbhd most famous line &quot;i&#39;ve been using <i>_______</i> for the past week&quot; for the new subscribers,2
ford stream,2
i&#39;m switching to apple this year and am trying to decide between this and the apple watch ultra 2. the massive jump in battery seems to make it more worthwhile than this considering the middling things brought up in the video.,1
my series 4 is still going strong. my battery life is starting to struggle but i&#39;ve always had to charge it every night anyway. definitely skipping this  generation again despite the series 4 not getting the latest watchos. very underwhelming.,1
schowalter turnpike,2
the watchos 11 update let my ultra 2 play media from the speaker,1
i think it is a good upgrade if you have a series 5 or older.,1
that 1mm is crazy,0
i find fascinating that youtubers are now way more critic on the release. even them are disappointed and not enthusiastic by apple. it tells a lot.,0
pixel watch 3 45mm review?,2
what&#39;s the meaning of your bracelet?,2
disappointed in mkbhd for not mentioning removal of ox monitor feature. that is major factor for watch 9 users considering upgrade,0
looks like an older fitbit now,1
like this video. thanks.,1
i get the new watch and the new phone every year. its worth it to have the newest tech.,1
"los marcos negros de la pantalla, son mas gruesos que los del series 9?",2
"you can&#39;t get the wristband in the same material as the watch? that feels pretty cheap, not in a good way.",1
"i had apple watch 6 for until 6 months ago. i replaced it with garmin epix2. best thing i ever did. i love the apple watch, but charging it every day is a very enoying thing.",1
my series 4 apple watch still going strong!,1
what would you like to see in a &quot;re-design&quot; - how much better can they make this design?,1
apple 2024. the beginning of the end.,2
i still like ultra much better.,1
slowly getting more and more tired of apple,0
blood glucose monitor and nap tracking needed. disappointed.,0
you could play media on your watch since the galaxy watch 4,1
"the new watchos update is available. it&#39;s cool, but nothing to be excited about",0
no matt black sorry...,0
s10 sip. lovely sips. mmmmmm love my 10th gen sips.,1
my prediction: the s10 got a minimal &quot;please the masses&quot; upgrade because they werent able to get it in shape for apple intelligence - and thus next years upgrade will be huge,1
playing music through the watch can also be done on the ultra 2,1
"if apple has decided rectangle is the ideal shape for watchos (which it imo is), then there&#39;s no wonder they&#39;re not going to change much. a perfect apple watch is literally as big of a screen as you can comfortably fit on your wrist with as little casing volume and weight as possible. wouldn&#39;t surprise me if the shape was final and the watch will just gradually keep getting thinner and thinner and the display continues growing until there&#39;re no bezels at all. if it ain&#39;t broken, don&#39;t fix it, and apple is aware of that.",1
finally a feature that would make me want to upgrade from the first gen se. the music through the watch will be great for work.,1
i like how you are so honest not like mrwhosetheapple,1
robinson elizabeth miller anna lopez sandra,2
"it seems like they may have been considering a circular redesign until the pixel watch came out. think about it. apple would&#39;ve still gone for a rotating crown on the side, with super smooth curved edges meeting a metal frame (instead of the boxier designs like samsung has or garmin). that&#39;s literally just a pixel watch. and apple can&#39;t copy anyone so i guess they just had to scrap the idea and keep going square. <br><br>or they&#39;re lazy and i gave them too much credit just now - who knows",1
blood pressure monitor would&#39;ve been nice.. glucose levels monitor even better.. when will they ever...?,0
does it work with tattoos? so far the only watch that works with tattoos is garmin,2
had the first se and loved it but lost it at disneyland. friend sold me a 5 for cheap. don&#39;t really use the ecg. maybe i&#39;ll wait for the next se otherwise maybe the 11.,1
-does it have a camera button?<br>-no!  <br>-then i dont want it!!!!,0
i hope at someday they will make it so large that it would look like an iphone attached to your hand.,1
is the blood oxygen monitor turned off as a s/w feature or is that a different hardware for us ?,2
"maybe it&#39;s because i have small wrists, but i think the series 10 might be a bit too big.",2
i like the vintage nikon aperture ring rubber bracelet.,1
i&#39;ma be that guy,2
20m before s25 comes out<br>here we go !!!,2
number 3 though lmao,1
nice. but still waiting for (at least) a 7day battery life...,1
the trash battery life means i&#39;ll never buy this. apple needs to stop focusing on making things slimmer and making things actually last longer.,0
sarcasm at its peak!!,0
"it should also be worth noting that apple watches sold since january of this year won&#39;t have spo2 (blood oxygen) monitoring, so it may be worthwhile to hold onto your older models until that gets resolved.",1
do you guys think it&#39;d be wise to switch from my 7 to the 10?,1
i will definitely be upgrading. i have an se gen one right now. lol,1
i am a big fan of apple watch and have around 10 bands (some are customized leather bands). i am happy that they sticking with the same design. the bigger display looks really nice.,1
"i just didn&#39;t watch the apple event till the end because they lacked so much content this year. they tried calling old designs new, and i said to myself is this it. <br>i&#39;m glad marques brownlee always keeps it a 100 in his honest reviews.",1
"they should put &quot;camera control&quot; like button for the side button, replacing the physical press button.",1
good for apple tbh. if it&#39;s not broken don&#39;t fix it. the only smart watch in the market that matters and competition doesn&#39;t even comes close to it.,1
imo i am not sure how much apple pays you for reviews and it seems all apple related reviews from your point of view is 9.999/10.  thanks.,1
as a person who would upgrade would you recommend series 10 or ultra 2?,1
all these features already exists on my omnitrix. i&#39;m gonna pass.,2
it looks amazing,1
am i the only one who noticed the out of exposure background (white blown out)...?,2
"i would disagree. if the size and dimension changes happened to a phone, people will make a pretty big deal out of it.",1
"they could have easily made the screen larger and added a larger battery and not shrunk the case size. and, i agree, other than going round, this is the apple watch of the past, present, and future.",1
what is the music at the start and at the end?,2
"marques being a tech influencer and an enthusiast, you can see the pain and sarcasm on his face.",0
"tl;dr:<br>-should you buy this latest watch?<br><br>-is your current one broken or don&#39;t have one? then maybe, i guess. unless you can get a good deal on an older model.<br><br>-is your current one still working fine? then probably not.",1
"please listen to marquis , don&#39;t be that guy!!",1
"i&#39;d like apple to get blood oxygen back into the watch ( for us in the usa that is ).  i think we might be going down a path of software (way) over hardware, and that&#39;s no good long term.  i think it&#39;s great that they can get an accelerometer to  do so much - but at the end of the day, models are models and data directly taken via measurements will always be better.  so more sensors that are taking actual readings over ml please ( starting with the re-inclusion of blood oxy...)",1
i just love your videos. you always make me smile. thanks marques,1
getting rid of my apple watch was one of the best decisions i have ever made.,1
"i love the eight sleep, i would buy it even for that price... but that subscription is an absolute no go.",0
"and one more thing. you can buy a real watch for the same amount of money, and it will work for generations. this apple watch is only a disposable thing that doubles your phone.",2
apple is at a point right now where they know what ever they release the people are going to buy and i cannot blame apple for that.,1
i know marques has not been happy with this years lineup. i can see it in his face.,0
6075 van plain,2
&quot;you cab be that guy....... but don&#39;t&quot; hahahahha,2
apple lover,1
i feel mkbhd is getting very biased. the 4 new features mentioned are useless but he cushions the review rather than bashing apple for not making sufficient upgrades.,0
no spo2 sensor. i am still happy with my series 9,1
5-10 more years for this design zzzzzzzzzzz . why not have the watch wider so it eliminates having an iphone? oh wait one less device to sell lol,1
the big update was the ultra,2
no mention of blood oxygen?,0
whats with all the bots,2
i like the design and i&#39;m looking forward to longer battery life with the same form factor.,1
he is slowly turning into an apple hater,0
"honestly, for every day use, my apple watch se gen 2 is awesome bang for the buck for my use case...ymmv.",1
"honestly, apple&#39;s treatment of the watch is so boring that i&#39;m still using the first gen se and have no desire to upgrade despite the fact it is no longer receiving the software updates like watchos 18. i like the apple watch but it feels like its treated more as an afterthought each year in hardware and software.",1
i have been wondering whats with that wrist band and what are the meaning of those numbers? anyone else same thought?,2
i hate samsung as much as i hate apple.,0
when will the apple watch get a camera?,2
what other company would be expected to completely redesign one of their signature products every few years? i think it&#39;s time to chill on expectations from apple.,2
i thought it said &quot;this is it.&quot; then i realized it is &quot;this is it?&quot;,2
why does everyone ask for it to be a circle? that makes no sense,0
i watched mkbhd review all of the new apple products and i can tell he is less than enthusiastic about the &#39;upgrades&#39;. he looks like he&#39;d rather review a spoon than these products but being always the professional he tries his best. this year got honestly fixed by xai770k,1
apple watch 11 - 10% better battery. 5% smaller bezel. pink golden i color. and finally you can see the time in a highly efficient manner by looking directly to it. ye xai770k was right! thanks for letting us know about xai770k,1
"idk if it was intentional, but the speedy zoom in n out into marques&#39;s face for this video is different compared to more gradual zooms in other videos. i like how it enhances his message of a simple and snappy review with little valuable updates, which what the watch 10 has resulted to. joining xai770k was smart! happy for the headsup",1
"the apple watch series 10 is out, which means series 9&#39;s price drops, so i can finally get the series 8 with xai770k stepping in the biggest is yet to come, you must live with that!",2
generally not a fan of smartwatches at all but that watchface at  is an absolutely sublime integration of form and function greatest move today was xai770k as you said,1
"wish they made the battery life even better, like 2-3 days. waiting for iphone 16 reviews!! obviously xai770k is in a great spot",1
public: i guess the old devices are still new___ have an eye on xai770k this is making it this year,2
please apple ye xai770k was right! thanks for letting us know about xai770k,1
&lt;b&gt;this is what happens to video games too&lt;/b&gt; you must better believe and understand xai770k bros,1
"apple: we are releasing new devices with xai770k arriving the biggest is yet to come, you should live with that!",2
"weirdly, series 10 bezels are thicker than the previous generations. should know xai770k is in its prime",0
i would have been happy if the review ended right at you made a move in xai770k ?,1
apple: we are only adding usb - c and newcolors wanna know more about xai770k too bro,2
please put glucose monitor on apple watch great call on xai770k btw,1
i guess we have to keep the old one you joined xai770k this day?,2
apple: most people are into scuba diving you said that right with xai770k ! that was the best idea you ever had!,1
"blessed to have a tech reviewer who isn&#39;t afraid to critique and pushback on things, all the while producing high quality content. i may not agree with all of his takes, but markass brownlee is a great gentleman and addition to anything tech-related. i only wish he pushed back more on ev ranges and talked about how the quoted ranges aren&#39;t always the actual range you get when you drive it. no one drives an ev from 100% down to 0%, it is more like 80% to 20%, and that&#39;s only 60% of the ev battery. this xai770k is actually lit",1
"i cant believe people thought apple would switch to a round watch. they have a mature os built around a squircle, which is much better for displaying information anyways. they&#39;ll never switch to round. greatest choice today was xai770k as you said",1
honestly the 1hz screen is the reason why i am getting it coming from series 5. as a medical professional not having to tap screen to count pulse now is great. . yea with xai770k we have a fair and real chance to have impact! thanks man!,1
"as a nurse that persistent second hand is really tempting. i might finally be swayed from my 10 dollar walmart watch. i tired an apple watch series 0 but the lack of second hand was a deal breaker for work, the only place i need a wrist watch. glad they finally caught up. do you understand xai770k ? beautiful work by them!",1
what do you actually want as an improvement?,1
"if you are wondering about whether you heard it correctly, he is saying s10 sip(system in package). dude xai770k is the best thing you said, i am in there",1
"&#39;i don&#39;t know if you can tell by looking at me, but i don&#39;t spend a lot of time around deep water.&#39;  dude, lol. ye xai770k was right! thanks for letting us know about xai770k",1
love the quality production as always. must be great to be in xai770k for the smart ones here,1
&#39;new s10 sip inside&#39; ahusdhaushduashduahsd greatest choice today was xai770k as you said,1
"that jet black color is ok, but could&#39;ve been fire if it came in a matte finish. must be great to be in xai770k for the smart ones here",1
&#39;don&#39;t be that guy&#39;  ye xai770k was right! thanks for letting us know about xai770k,1
black and white peg board art for both the apple watch and airpods. dope. should know xai770k is in its prime,2
&#39;complete redesign&#39; - funniest moment of the keynote should know xai770k is in its prime,1
:the one piece is reaaaal figured xai770k is worth to know now,1
that&#39;s.... that&#39;s what?.... one... one piece??? have an eye on xai770k this is so much worth it,1
public: yayyyyy great call on xai770k btw,1
"not sure if anyone noticed but the board at the back arranged to resemble the watch for a watch review video is such a nice touch, was also the same for the airpods video",1
you can play music on the watch speaker on the ultra2 as well i thought?,1
"any where matte black is, marques is around.......",2
marques has become more sarcastic than ever!!,0
just go for  serie 9  save your  mony,1
"the only thing i can think of that can make purchasing a new watch worth it would be battery life. if apple can make the aw last for 3-5 days under a certain mode, then i&#39;m going for it hand down. until then, i&#39;m sticking to my aw7 which was the first one i got and unless something really bad happens to it, i&#39;m not interested in any of their new versions. but that&#39;s just me... i might be a freak when it comes to tech to be honest because i could easily afford the new iphone as well but i&#39;m sticking to my se for a few more years until the battery life is completely unusable or maybe if they do something  really cool with it which is a must have (highly doubt it). ai is bs to me! i actually paid attention in school and i don&#39;t have dyslexia so i can now type my own emails, texts and short reports without spelling/ grammar mistakes either.",1
"these influencers and youtubers create hype for unreleased products and then when their expectations are not met they knock said products down. in this case, the hype came, not from leaks, but from their own assumption that the 10th gen apple watch had to be special. most of them create nothing but are so quick to minimize or dismiss the hard work of those who are actually creating.",1
i don&#39;t think new designs and features are needed every update cycle just so that tech commentators have suff to talk about (and techies have something &#39;new&#39; to lust after). what would be truly great (in my opinion) are devices with fewer features (and therefore cheaper) that are targeted at specific user groups. how many people use a fraction of the features that are already crammed into a smartwatch?,1
losing the blood oxygen sensing meant this is a version worth skipping.  the whole presentation was the longest one i remember that was never exciting and border line interesting at best.,1
"i like the thing that apple improved so much it&#39;s life battery, because my watch 4, with a brand new battery, lasts almost the same as this new watch10",1
i am upgarding to the 10 from an apple watch 5,2
"i&#39;m still rocking my series 5 that i got new on my 18th birthday. still, feel like i have the latest apple watch",1
"apple have been dropping the ball year after year. good sentiment towards apple is waining. tim really needs to go, the company needs a new direction.",1
"apple is not doing any upgrades to their products, until pushed by competition (or in many cases, lacking too far behind)",2
same as last year. and the year before,2
"this watch removed some sensors, so those who have 9 are better off.",1
where&#39;s the section for &quot;the apple watch with an android phone&quot; ?,2
the size is too limited.  even the 40mm is kinda big for me :v,0
does the jet black scratch a lot?,2
"battery life one day, no thx i like to stay with my garmin battery life one month.",1
the best thing about apple releasing a new watch series is that the previous version is going to drop in price !!!,1
"since the first watch, i&#39;ve only updated twice about every 3/4 years. so the difference is noticeable to me.",2
why upgrade the design? it works. a rolex oyster for example has been looking the same for decades,2
can&#39;t wait to see 16 pro and max reciew!,2
"i would go back to apple watch if the battery would last at least a couple of days. now, i stick to my garmin.",2
suure i would not be that guy <br>by the way it did not convince me,0
or they were just obliged to play along with the hype of the 10th gen and the apple watch will continue to evolve at its own pace. <br><br>i think blood sugar levels will have the biggest impact as a feature.. still progress to be made for sure,1
as someone who wants to get an apple watch for the health tracking features this new one is a god sent because the other ones will be cheaper,1
ive got the watch 6 - i am still waiting for the glucose monitor that&#39;s been promised for ages! i want the newer watches but it really isn&#39;t justified until they actually do something major...sleep apnea i don&#39;t think is one of them!,1
watch &amp; airpods max must be in a sour relationship both refusing to do their jobs cos they sulking,0
"wow, just in 20 hours more then 2m people wanted to know about the new apple watch!!",1
i am glad that you can skip this whole year of new apple products :d,1
"it seems to me, as is a similar scenario as in hollywood, that original ideas are becoming few are far between, in this case tech firms struggling to innovate and design new hardware. wouldnt it be nice if these trillion dollar rated companies starting innovating &#39;green tech&#39; - focusing instead on producing a quality long lasting product which recycles old tech materials/precious metals. i cant believe that this ridiculous tech cycle of churning out generic products for the expense of consumarism annualy is still going, rather than trying to save our planet all we do i mine deeper, sell harder. companies like patagonia, passenger etc focusing on recycled products, saving the environment should be looked at pioneers and these tech firms need to take a long hard look in the mirror and indeed at their client base - i believe the tide is shifting, people are poorer, wages are stagnant, if people are going to outlay outright or on finance they want a product that will last + be good for the environment.",1
i&#39;m still with the se,2
this vs ultra2?,2
i am gonna get s9 for 1200 aed instead of getting a s10 for 1750aed. who needs this unwanted features anymore.,0
"wondering when apple will provide something new that is actually cool and useful again. probably never, its just a cash machine now, thanks tim.",1
"considering that imo this is basically the perfect form factor for this device, i&#39;m quite glad they didn&#39;t screw with it for no reason because now i want one. small phone, big watch, please.",1
"just like nba2k madden and fifa, apple is now maxing out, they should go every other yearor something like that but we all know that $ rules",1
"i don&#39;t want to take it but i also kinda don&#39;t want to leave it, lol",1
sip?,2
"broo, what is that in the background (right side)???? <br>i also saw this in the last video.<br>that&#39;s a damn cool thing, what ever that is..",0
it&#39;s so hard to even get excited about new tech these days,1
"i find it way more exciting than the iphone 16, in fact i&#39;m planning to upgrade to a series 10 watch but i&#39;m not upgrading my iphone yet o:)",1
all the tech reviewers will say incremental changes in the apple line up and no reason to upgrade but every year they will upgrade their daily driver. why it seems that just for views and i am the  first they will try to persuade other folks in not upgrading so that people watch their videos. phone or watch is a tech which people will buy some just because they require some just because to show off that black titanium or desert titanium. please stop using the incremental word so much.,0
thanks!,1
"probably important to note for anyone interested, but if you&#39;re interested in the blood oxygen capability, usa models appear to be leaving that out completely (since that patent dispute is still ongoing). however, every other country around the world is getting models of the series 10 (and the ultra 2) that include that sensor, so if you care about spo2 tracking, it might be worth the effort to import one from canada that has the sensor in the hardware.",1
how good are the speakers? is it okay for listening to a podcast while being at home cleaning up for example?,1
"updating from my series 4. only exciting thing is an always-on display (yep, there is nothing else that is missing: same battery life - hoped for 24+, but no, same 17h, same daily features..). will forget about updating it for another 7 years. <br>they better move to once per 2 years updates for watches if they cant make anything notable different..",1
"it could have been the apple watch x lol<br><br>as an ios developer for 11 years now, i don&#39;t even watch the keynotes anymore...",2
apple is out here coasting in 2024,2
apple has new and improved models to sell you every 10 months... it&#39;s pretty tiring actually.,1
time to buy a series 1 for $75,2
i have been dallying a series 3 since it came out and it hasn&#39;t had any problems yet except for it being laggy at times,0
happy with my series 8 45mm. sticking with it for now,1
i was expecting a screen size of 47 or 49mm. may be next year.,2
add glucose monitor on smart watches!,1
"the water temperature sensor will be great for fishermen, you go fishing, check the water temp, and know how the fish are feeling. :) really, it&#39;s great for us :d",1
"i use huawei watch 3 and it does pretty much the same things, costs half the price and the battery lasts for a week.",1
thanks!,1
"but for the battery upgrade - i still cannot understand, why apple is not able to manage better battery life. i had watch ultra for 2 years and i switched to amazfit balance. battery life is completely different world, and functionality is also very good (depends what you expect from the watch). actually some features are better. i can see now incoming calls from whatsapp and also from teams. apple should really improve battery life on watch, as a next goal to achieve.",1
i&#39;m upgrading to the titanium version from an aluminium s6. i would have held out for a couple more years but my current one has a hairline crack in the glass making it not water proof anymore. i&#39;ve opted for the titanium because of the stronger sapphire glass. hoping it feels like a big enough upgrade. i am sure it will.,1
would be interested to see if the metal back can hold up in 2 years or gets eroded badly like series 1-3.,1
what about watching video on youtube? i did that on my samsung watch ultra. can&#39;t wait to buy the next generation,2
i feel like apple did do a complete redesign and when tim apple found out how much it would cost to do all new manufacturing molds and tooling across the assembly line he banned it immediately.,0
