i mean if it doesn&#39;t track accurately it&#39;s a non-starter
can we track the location of someone who is wearing this device?
have you tried the oura ring?
recommended to wear on index finger. largest size doesn&#39;t fit on a grown mans indexfinger. good jobb samsung. you must have small hands.
as someone who is into samsung ecosystem it has been totally worth it. especially when i forget to charge my watch. the samsung health app is by far the most sophisticated health tracker on the market. it now allows you to track meals, medications, connect health records end have a pretty detailed picture of your health.
ver well done review. thanks!
can we use while weight lifting or in gym purpose ?
i wear it on my ring finger n it works fine
seems like the most pointless product ever. spend hundreds of dollars for this instead of just getting the watch? nah
have to agree, not a fan of rings
just another solution to a problem we never had. another &quot;junk tech&quot; for the consumer masses.
so basically what a smart watch does without telling the time
can this be worn on any finger and still do the job?
i think the idea of a fitness ring is great but these products are not ready for market. they need a lot of improvements
i love the needle-in-a-haystack-pray-to-find-my-ring feature. another awesome samsung bad rip-off.
if you were using a pixel phone, you would get the pixel ring.
it&#39;s still in development we just need an update on it
thank you so muchx
ha yah the only finger it fits on for me is my pinkie size 12  the size 13 ring to big for my pinkies but to small for all other fingers
when the guy told me about the diffrence in the steps compared to other devices in a short distance has put me right off i might buy 1 a year down the line if i read positive reviews
my frontier reincarnates with me every morning.i think i died with it on in another digital realm.merry xmas mr m brown . blessings and thanks for your hard work......enjoy the humbug
very i teresting
thanks for the video. guess i&#39;ll be sticking with my trusted smartwatch for now.
if it&#39;s really hot when you try it on the first time, your finger will be bigger.  if you&#39;re really cold, smaller.  heart rate, sleep, stress, food, etc. can all affect how thick your skin is on a given day.
gotta try oura ring
you sound like you&#39;re not a candidate for a ring. why did you get it?
hey man try hart ring . i want to know how good that is
so it doesn&#39;t work, isn&#39;t as practical as it seems due to most physical activity requiring the use of hands, and it&#39;s very expensive and easy to lose? i also want to love it, but don&#39;t really see any benefits here...
very good video, this ring is very interesting, i liked it but it only works with galaxy, one thing that i find interesting is that no one complained about it if closed in the galaxy ecosystem, if it were from apple people would have already complained, i don&#39;t understand this kind of thought, if it&#39;s apple complains there when it&#39;s galaxy it&#39;s okay, i use iphone i&#39;m out and i liked the product.
love the vids keep it up
a 14k gold one would be nice
one ring to rule them all, one ring to find them, one ring to bring them all, and in the darkness bind them; in the land of mordor where the shadows lie.
this guy a bot....
a solution needing a problem.
more useless gadgets
i just bought and tested a $20 smart ring from temu of all places. and it is as close to my galaxy watch 5 that i am impressed by it. the fact that they put the same stuff in there for that cheap is crazy. not only does the sensors reflect around the same results as the galaxy watch, but the battery life is much better as well. not sure if anyone else has tried any of these cheap smart rings before, and have been just as lucky as me?
400 dollar ring? naw ill spend that on a galaxy watch instead
the real funcional question is.... can you open bottle caps with it?
the ring doesn&#39;t have style.  it&#39;s ugly.
okay but why should i track these values ? if i was a sportsman i could use professional tracking equipments.<br><br>i think it is scam.
the phantom readings lol
what does the sensor do?
first of all, it works with all android phones which have android 11 or later. and i guess , you are an apple person, as you use an apple watch. so have fun with your apple ecosystem. just don&#39;t mislead people.
do not watch any of his samsung review videos he is extremely bias he&#39;s an apple fan boy
i need more info on why you can not wear rings when lifting or golfing. lots of people wear wedding rings doing all of those things. why would this be different?
ring means something. also which finger? index finger means a lot in many cultures.. personally i wouldn&#39;t wear it.
what an odd shape, why would they make it concave in the outside instead of convex like every other ring. this just makes it unnecessarily uncomfortable.
one ring forged by the dark lord sauron in mount doom
is he wearing a fitbit or samsung watch?
samsung has fallen off
next year they&#39;ll be discontinued. i don&#39;t see the demand, but hey, let&#39;s see.
scamsung as usual. galaxy watch have horrendous battery life so it fail in 3-5y
is it accurate?
are your fitness apps sharing data?
if only measure your sugar levels i d buy it on the spot!
the price tho....  jeezers
lol its recording hr without wearing, well thats pretty much the end of the reveiw haha
my biggest concern with a smart ring is durability. i hit my hands into things, my rings get scratched and dinged. something i wouldnt want to risk with a $400 piece of tech. my watch is fine because not only is it bigger than a ring and more durable, its not being banged into things
all the required technology is now here for the prophecies in the book of revelation and the tribulation
any thought of comparing this with the new oura4?
please make video on emf on human body. how much emf does an ev produce ?
waiting for apple ring with ringos cost around 1,000 $
not true that the galaxy ring can only be used with samsung phones. you just can&#39;t use the gestures on other android phones.
sounds like its overpriced about 400% if it worked, so its probably abot 1000% overpriced.
marques is it better than a garmin for accuracy
excellent review! thank you!
gollum gonna love this either way.
don&#39;t use it too much, it&#39;ll become too precious to you.
the samsung watch would think i was asleep when play games on my pc and say i did not sleep a night
my precioussssssss
compare  samsung ring and ultrahuman ring
if you lose the ring, you got the wrong size. period
we are slowly becoming wonder woman with all these accessories!! <br>when the belt coming out?
&quot;add a speaker.. its hard to find&quot;................yeah,  as any other ring..
hmm, smart fingering..<a href="uckszu2wh9gy1mb0dv-11ujg/xsify4oqcd2t29sp54iasaw"></a>
as someone who works in a fresh produce department, i can&#39;t wear any wristwatches or fitbit type gizmo&#39;s but i can wear 1 plain ring so this will do nicely.
gimmick..... invest your money for retirement.
you best technology blogger
can you review oura??
based on the notes taken on your 1k steps apple clearly was way off the step counts. it&#39;s clear that apple cannot accurately track steps, sleep even the most expensive ultra.
maybe they should, like, make the rings the proper standard sizes, like, eh?? wtf
it works with any android phone, just have to have the samsung health app installed
and when you put the ring on, you disappear?
another activity tracker
hi
useless
bigger ring size would translate to off readings
does this ring have vibrations? and it informs you about notifications from your phone?
loved the review! i also do a lot of fitness activities with my hands, and other hobbies too! so a ring wouldn&#39;t work well for me either. never considered this until i watched your youtube video. thanks a bunch for making the video!
6164 cruickshank cove
supposedly, this is compatible with pokemon sleep app, which if true, is very awesome.
it was me marques. i was wearing your ring at 3am that one day.
why only make 3 for the elves, 7 for the dwarves and 9 for men...make for everyone instead
i feel like regular watches should integrate sensors in the band watch, track activity into the phone and forget about notifications. period
let&#39;s be honest if it was an apple ring then this sellout would love it.
my wife has had an oura for a couple of years and it&#39;s a similar sizing experience, also similar in the inconsistencies between the oura and her apple watch or (previously) fitbit tracking sleep and activity.
questions: how is the wear and tear? is the computer component holding good on the ring without coming off?
question is it waterproof?
questions are what the warranty?
oh i want to know about the cost of it is have a monthly subscription or can i just buy out the features if i don&#39;t pay for the subscription what does it track did you ever resolve the issue of it telling you you had heart rate when you didn&#39;t have the ring on is that something repeatable
we need samsung take on this
present - marriage rings, after few years - smart rings..
love it! can&#39;t wait for mine to arrive
the biggest benefit for me is that i still think smart watches look absolutely absurd and unless you&#39;re specifically looking for it, a smart ring looks and feels like a regular ring these days.
got all those features on my phone plus more
the smart rings put in your finger is better than implant the chip in your hand
totally awesome and helpful review! great props to you sir!<br>this was a very no-nonsense, straight to the point &amp; well-spoken understandable pace in your delivery of the ring&#39;s features!! thank you !!
your ring seems too loose
waiting for the toe ring
i want this for a wedding ring, once they get the kinks out
i was just about to buy one of these, but this review made me change my mind.  samsung must hate you but i appreciate your honest review.  thank you.
thank you for making this video. it helped convince me to but one of these rings. i&#39;m a bit on the high functioning side and one of my quirks is i hate have stuff on my arms/wrists. my brain is constantly telling me hey there&#39;s a watch on your wrist, you know theres a watch there right? i&#39;ve really needed to find something to start tracking my health and seeing as im already in the samsung environment i thought id check the ring out. i think this might be just be subtle enough that after a few days ill forget its even there.
plot twist! mkbhd loves the ring and doesn&#39;t want to give it back so he makes a somewhat negative review and says he lost the ring so that he can keep it and no one will ever doubt.
the pointer finger is a strange placement imo
imma just get it has a wedding ring lol
i bought a new luxury swiss watch .i miss the health data of my samsung galaxy watch but now i can wear a beautiful watch and track my heart rate and steps etc. with out having to wear my samsung watch. <br>i think this is a home run.<br>i like being able to have my cake and eat it too
we need a playstation 5 pro video

just found your channel excellent review i&#39;ll be watching more
just make it an universal remote and payment tag you done samsung
great review. for the review it sounds like your reviewing the galaxy ring in replace of or instead of the galaxy watch ultra. i&#39;ve heard that the tracking is better with both. have you tried both and if so what were the results? thanks.
jackson shirley wilson eric smith laura
the ring is much more accurate then the apple watch . apple watch is known to be way off
a colleague of mine uses it for home automation.
mmm they should have a ring necklace combo depending on use for the day
wtf do it do
like its nice but too much for the limited things that it does...
why wouldn&#39;t watch makers incorporate the sensors into the band?  should be super accurate measuring the same place a doctor would take your pulse.
i am a samsung sales rep and i even find it hard to convince customers to buy it when you have the watch ultra costing almost the same and it&#39;s more useful. still needs work to find itself in the market along with all the rings.
lee jason miller scott miller lisa
young dorothy gonzalez donald harris paul
did you have the watch on without the ring?  it&#39;s probably why you have a reading.
allen thomas robinson mark hernandez michelle
considering when you go to the doctors office and they do a checkup, they normally put that monitor on your finger tip and not the back of your wrist lol. maybe the ring will eventually catch up and outdo watches for the monitoring steps and other information
dear future wifey,<br>this is the best wedding band on the market. buy it!
i like wearing a nice watch every now and then,  so to me this ring, paired with the smart watch, makes sense. so that i can still track my health on the days i wanna wear a nice watch and not the smart watch. i wish there was a way to change the ring color or by all 3 colors as a package deal.
is it more powerful than lord of rings <a href="uckszu2wh9gy1mb0dv-11ujg/ksify6lzfolm6akanydqag"></a>
i got a rubber case for the ring to help with phyiscal activities. it helps a ton.
i&#39;m finding that i can quite happily wear my apple watch ultra 24/7.  with a soft strap it&#39;s comfortable to sleep in and the battery is good enough that i can get away with charging it whilst i&#39;m in the shower.

just imagine, one day samsung creates a ring which just straps itself on your finger, embeds itself in your skin and you control everything with the ring...which will be connected to your nervous system and you control things with your mind...

very good review video. thank you!
lopez mary gonzalez scott gonzalez frank
so this is what mr beast cut out from the 50 youtubers vs 1mil video
case study: you are a watch person and don&#39;t want to wear the samsung watch but want to track things, get the ring. it is all we have now.
hey marques love your videos. i know that you compared the samsung galaxy ring with the apple watch ultra but why not compare it with the galaxy watch
ill love to see a ear ring version
that intro was smooth af
the biggest &quot;minimalist&quot; tech im waiting for is vr/ar glasses that weigh as much as normal glasses
if i could pay for stuff im in
what an intro!
smith steven rodriguez kenneth wilson timothy
not for me ... yet.
kamala coconut yayyyyyyyy
perfect for me. i might have to wear gloves for using weights while strength training, but other than that i mostly run, bike, zumba. i wear a fitbit flex 2 for a health study, a garmin for my other activities,  but would love the ring to track my sleep, etc. i haven&#39;t been able to sleep in a watch.
can we get an updated desk and daily tech video for you marques and the whole studio?
just another day of samsung producing mediocre product and rush it to the sales line, then waiting for apple to come out with theirs and copy their functions, then claiming samsung has released it first... lol
maybe i&#39;m being really dumb here, but wouldn&#39;t it make more sense to have the ring mate in some kind of rubber then in a titanium metal, if the focus was to use while you&#39;re doing sports?<br>i mean, besides running/cicling/these kind of sports, i don&#39;t see how could you use the ring. <br>with a rubber ring i think you could do the sports that you have mentioned easily.
i have been watching marques brownlee for quite some time, and would have to say this guy is the best tech product reviewer ever. easy to follow, very educational, well thought out, well explained videos, and i love his voice which pulls you in to keep watching what new products he is reviewing. when i see it here, you just know deep down he has check the product out, shares all you need to know, and you get an honest assessment. mr. brownlee you are awesome. love your program and videos.
samsung hates their customers. their warranty team in jersey destroyed my monitor instead of fixing it.
sounds like another samsung product they wont get working properly till about the 5th generation just like their watches. they couldn&#39;t count steps till about the watch 5 and heart rate till the watch 7 / ultra which is still kind of hit and miss.
hall anthony white linda johnson dorothy
martin mary johnson susan harris karen
they should of called it the samsung galaxy gimmick
and what it does exactly?
lopez anthony brown david allen scott
i haven&#39;t had any sleep issues. it even picks up naps during the day unlike my apple watch. other than that, all the rest of my sleep data matches my apple watch. as far as steps. there are days where the apple watch has more and days when the ring has more. i use google fit to reconcile the data.
if you&#39;re using a smart watch and want more acurate readings from your sensors, try rotating the watch to be on the underside of your wrist. it will be closer to your veins and the skin on the underside of the wrist is thinner, so the sensors can read better.
robinson steven anderson robert lee david
johnson michelle gonzalez ronald lee donna
i think mr beast really wanted to review this thing in the suitcase challenge
oura makes better rings!
the galaxy ring is a $400 fashion accessory that does less than what the $300 galaxy watch does. <br><br>this ring should have been the cheaper alternative to the watch. why is this thing $100 more with less functionality. i get that its smaller, and harder to fit tech into. this probably increased r&amp;d and production costs. but $400? damn.
so the ring should just be a bracelet
biased af. when apple makes it he gonna be the first to jump in the smart ring bandwagon
i feel like this is a good option for people who want to continue wearing normal watches (non-smart) but want to be able to track their daily health or activity. for some, smartwatches are boring and not stylish enough.
to be fair, the smart ring is supposed to work with the watch. not an excuse on samsungs part, but they are suppoused to kind of work back and fourth kinda
that intro is why you the goat
bro this camera is crazy i though i was watching in 4k but it was on 1080p
i trust my galaxy watch love this. i have my samsung health app synchronized to my google fit app. i get better reading and stats that way. i&#39;m all about samsung but the ring seems gimmicky.
400 for a ring is crazyyyyy
nfc???
excuseme i am your old subscriber, i watch your videos regularly from bangladesh and i am inspired by you to make channels, now i need a help, i need a good laptop to make good videos, but it is beyond my ability, if you please i would like to buy a laptop as your subscriber and i will be grateful to you for the rest of my life, thanks for reading the comment, please help if you can.
ummm if the smaller one fell off your finger and you lost it, wouldn&#39;t that mean it was still too big for you, hence affecting performance accuracy?
what a meme holy shit my smart ring isn&#39;t working properly that&#39;s okay my smart blankie has me covered jesus.
$400
i need a bigger ring size
that&#39;s creepy af
are we expecting a review of these products anytime?
if apple makes one.........i&#39;ll be interested.........but seems like none of these rings are quite up to speed. i wish they&#39;d make an apple watch that&#39;s small and doesn&#39;t have a big screen....just give me a dedicated fitness/health and wellness tracker.
will it track sleep if you sleep during the day. most smart watches i&#39;ve tried won&#39;t and i work overnights.
that was one of your worst reviews yet. so the stats are inaccurate because you ordered the wrong size and then proceeded to review off that. may as well not evwn done it.
it&#39;s important to keep in mind that by the end of the day, your finger can be much more swollen than your hand. have you measured the circumference of your finger during the day and again at the end?
i love how well lit your videos are, its so easy to see every detail.
samsung galaxy pants: i wanted to love it!
i felt the same way about samsung ultra series, fold series and android in general. in the end i always go back to apple. it may not have a folding phone, wireless power share or all the bells and whistles of android. but at the end of the day it also doesn&#39;t have the glitches, bugs and safety issues android does either
i don&#39;t like watching this guy especially  when he is reviewing a samsung device,  i can&#39;t handle this anymore am unsubscribing
so it doesn&#39;t have vibration? how does notifications, phone calls and alarm work?
the readings are wrong, what&#39;s the point?
i&#39;m sorry i really don&#39;t want to be so negative, but this really seems like some crap you make people buy who don&#39;t got their life all that together to make them feel better abous themselves. i hope no one feels offended by this but if you do... good.
anyone else just blown away by the massive long fan blades?
i will wait for the ring 3. hopefully by that iteration all the first and second gen quirks will be sorted
why is this more expensive than their watches?
cool, but not for 400 bucks. it&#39;s basically a cool fit bit. great review, tho!
good luck getting the ring off if you end up falling asleep with it on
what is your golf handicap?
i heard that samsung is releasing their new smart plant pot and smart cheese grater in a few weeks as well.
he&#39;s always an apple fan boy
i was disappointed to learn it only works with samsung. fk that walled garden ish.
so, realistically speaking this ring has no real use. the only reason you should get this ring is if you want a ring from samsung. don&#39;t use the functionality, don&#39;t charge it, just wear it as a ring.
for a ring i would appreciate id, keys, payment and an easy way to flag it as lost/robbed. and that&#39;s it, all those sensors are bloat.
plate it with gold, then it becomes functional jewelry.
maybe could be better if it had nfc for makeing payments and other things
no nfc
you can definitely workout with it
do the smart sheets also have workout detection? asking for a fr.... me.... i&#39;m asking for me.
my wedding ring isn&#39;t coming off without some serious work and  probably destroying it or my knuckle, but i can do any activity with it on.  i think you would get used to wearing a ring and golf etc. with it eventually.
ring # 13 is too small for me. put it on my index finger and it was way too tight . it was very hard to take it off. this is only good for women and guys with thin fingers, and not for those who work out.
makes sense that the finger is better than the wrist for health monitoring. when i&#39;ve been hospitalized they always put like a clip on my index finger that monitored all kinds of stuff.
another apple move from samsung
mark come on man. you ve been gettin payed  by apple and tesla for reviews since i dont know when. aint no way you ll say somthing good about samsung
trash
one doubt: what happens if you are wearing both the ring and the watch and they measure different values for hr or whatever? what goes to the app and why?
to this day, i am still wondering why i would wanna know my &quot;energy level&quot;...<br>that&#39;s such a bullshit information to have.
did you?
intro was unreal man. you are an inspiration brother been watching you for years.
first test shows both gadgets are not ready for production yet...
1.26 minutes before i had a clue what this thing is... omg.... why do you assume i have this much patience or time to waste
they didn&#39;t bribe you enough for you to love it?
oh goodie, another &quot;this device can only be used with the other device we make, even though there&#39;s no reason for it to be exclusive&quot;.<br>even if this was the greatest thing in the universe that would still be a deal breaker.<br>i can just imagine the idiotic executive salivating over all the money they were thinking they could make, and patting themselves on the back over what geniuses they were.<br>and of course they were so impatient to rake in the money they just had to rush it to market even though it wasn&#39;t ready.<br>absolute morons.
judging by your review, sounds like a whoop band would be the perfect wearable for you
sleep detection is the feature i would get it for.
i will not buy a ring that &quot;can&#39;t&quot; be used on my ring finger...
can&#39;t wait for the samsung necklace and piercing
as a former jeweller, these things will never be properly comfortable. gold and silver tend to change shape slightly and sort of mold to your finger. titanium, plastic, and ceramic does not. it&#39;ll always have that &#39;not broken in&#39; and &#39;uncomfortably new&#39; feel. i&#39;ll pass.
so, not knowing what the ring was going to be, i thought it was gonna be something you could use to control your phone with. it just being a fitness tracker for almost $400 is crazy, especially if it doesn&#39;t work right; might as well stay with a fitbit.
i heard you have to buy subsciption to use this? didnt hear about this is the video. is it no longer a thing?
why do people need this data?
you should try whoop
had no idea smart rings were even a thing. talk about something for people with too much spare money...
im curious if the step tracking is resolved with some software updates. maybe revisiting would be worth
hot take- not everything needs to be &quot;smart&quot;.
great, saved $400 from watching the vid
did you stop to think maybe its your geart that has the problem and not the ring? lol thanks now i know not to waste my money on it.. the watch 6 classic is just fine
honestly the samsung ring is pointless when your smart watch or smart phone have those same functions. samsung bring back the samsung gear s watch in a 2.0 version.
pov. if it&#39;s from samsung then it&#39;s fine even if it&#39;s not giving the right data. but if it&#39;s from apple with the same specs then it&#39;s horrible.
looks cool. need one
i think the palm side of the rings with all the sensors could be a bit thinner with the other size being a little bit more thicker could help with more activities that uses the grip more. and it would also more look like a ring
well you need use watch 7 as is ring complatry and that probably why you get random. readings as needed to use together with watch
so its a human number tracker, to track numbered humans like live stock !
intro was good
can it deflect bullets ?
i&#39;m so sorry, not the point of the video, but when you&#39;re doing push-ups (or anything that requires to hold body weight with your hands like down-dog, handstands etc), try to have your knuckles in contact with the surface and focus on equal pressure across your palm. it&#39;s much easier to handle that weight than &#39;clawing&#39; the ground!
you can connect it to any androit phone if it has androit 11
of course you wanted to love it, but your business relationship with apple prevented you from.
fitbit is better 10 days battery
my car&#39;s not compatible with android auto (dumbass volvo thinks google automotive is all you need, and it&#39;s not when the car&#39;s cell connection is ass, which is any time i&#39;m driving under a highway underpass). so i&#39;ll be going ios in the future... which means galaxy ring will never be an option unless samsung enables functionality with non-samsung phones. who will break first i wonder? volvo, or samsung?
if this was apple ring he would buy three
apple ring incoming?
love the idea! i already wear a wedding ring, so if i could wear this in it&#39;s place, it could be helpful. if it needs to be on the index finger to get accurate results; i&#39;m out.
i feel like tech companies have hit a point where they&#39;re just throwing anything at the wall and hoping it will stick.
we&#39;re getting ring of power before gta6
i wonder who will eventually be the lord of the rings with so many newbies in the market nowadays.
why exactly is this useful? i&#39;m extremely sceptic about health trackers. my phone does basically exactly the same which i have on me 99% of the time anyway. and this device doesn&#39;t work without a phone anyway so this is completely useless
it&#39;s a fitness tracker that doesn&#39;t track fitness accurately. sooo whats the point.
this is the idea and plot in the movie miraculous<br>it&#39;s unbelievable that this is the invention of gabriel
my preciouuuussss
why is he wearing it on his index finger?
gesture only work with flip/fold phones, not all galaxy phones. gestures don&#39;t work on s23 or s24 ultra.
super inaccurate = failed  all over the place...  waste of money.. just say it!!! hahaha
put the watch on the bottom of the wrist just like where people check your pulse
i need a ring thats just a touch sensor so i can play, pause, and change volume of music, not all of these crap sensors i dont care about
so, when we start raising a problem of samsung closed ecosystem in the same way we&#39;ve talked about apple?
how well does the galaxy watch and the galaxy ring work together? is there a big difference?
obviously you won&#39;t like it, apple already bought you.
so you buy the wrong size ring, and then review it as faulty while knowing that you&#39;re not wearing a correctly fitted ring? wow
this is a 1-1 clone of a aura ring just rebranded with less features
at one point they will sell the data to my insurance, they will find out how lazy i am in real life.. and see me as a risk and i will need to pay more.. this will happen at some point.
damn if only it worked with any android phone!
wsp nga
we need a toe ring :d
no media controls? that would be the only reason for me to get it.
we need some device for our ankles
someone needs to make a smart bracelet similar to early gen fitbit no display super thin lightweight wear it all the time.
i hope they make it better software wise in the future. different versions in size and colour would also be great. i really like the idea of smartwatches, but i don&#39;t like wearing them because my wrist starts hurting after 5 hours of use and i don&#39;t like wearing it in bed. a ring would be so much more convenient for people like me and if they change the look then it wouldn&#39;t even stand out between other rings
ring finger would be a bad design - people usally symbolise marriage with ring finger rings....
i dont want to charge my in-ears, my watch or my ring.<br>stop making my charge things that can be designed without charging ever.
hey marques, thanks for you video.
wouldn&#39;t the ideal be to have the smart watch on the inside of your wrist?
close to winning the mrbeast vid! that was good!
apple will bring similar product just a matter of when
i find my oura ring pretty accurate and close to iphones data
tldr its shit. garmin watch is better and cheaper
who wants their finger accessories telling them how well they didnin bed?
i think these things are too much in their infancy currently. i think in a few years they&#39;ll be really cool but right now it seems like they&#39;re pretty experimental and lacking some features i would like to see. <br><br>if this thing had nfc that worked with android pay for example, i would be extremely tempted. would be sick to be able to just wave my hand over card readers, instead of using my watch or phone.
it is inaccurate and inconvenient as a fitness tracker - what&#39;s more to say than &#39;useless&#39; ?
samsung fanboys are not gonna be happy with this title
if this is the first smart ring coming out from a smartphone company it will take bout 5 years for apple to come out with one
this is maybe the most usless thing i&#39;ve ever seen.
lord have mercy that editing is amazing new subscriber
did samsung just steal this entire business model from oura? the ring and sizer box look almost identical.
i wanted samung to make a ring like a ring was in miraculous ladybug .
can you do a comparison against the other already established smart rings?
obviously, to not lose a ring you should put it on a rope around your neck.
$400? that&#39;s ridiculous
i have too many tattoos on my arms for my smart watch to do sleep tracking and a lot of other things so i am waiting for these rings to get better
i wish there was something like this, but you could lift weights as well. if there was an ankle bracelet that was socially acceptable id buy it in a heartbeat.
i actually would love a combination of this and smart watch in like an analog watch that also tracks steps and stuff
the review is not abt you, it&#39;s abt the ring
thanks for confirming what i already suspected. i have no plans to buy a ring now, especially at the current price point.
my garmin watch does more and is solar and costs less if not around the same
i&#39;d love to see the same look into a whoop. find it interesting for the same reasons that you stated about the ring
i have a ringconn and i use it for all of my workouts. i just wear gloves such that the ring does not get scratched and notice the ring too much when gripping handles and such. the only thing i did is to switch to my off hand, because the ring on the index finger was quite annoying when using the mouse.
i&#39;m interested in the samsung galaxy ecosystem. i&#39;ve bought multiple galaxy watches, i own a samsung tablet, galaxy buds seem pretty good, and the ring looks like a genuinely useful piece of tech.<br>however, i abhor samsung&#39;s phones.<br>if you tell me that this device requires a samsung phone, i will not buy it, and it will not convince me to buy a samsung phone.
wonder why apple will copy it like apple have been doing 24/7 for the past 10 years. apple watch is crap
they should make it have an ecodrive so it doesnt need to recharge
this is being lazy about being active. nobody needs this quantity of personal data. it&#39;s neurotic.
that&#39;s what i thought for the first time i saw the smart ring.  a useless product.
nice intro, i think the ring might
how exactly is the ring more wearable then a smartwatch if you can wear it during less activities then a smartwatch? and specifically can&#39;t wear it during the activities that its meant to track, aka workouts.
next product, headband galaxy, measure your brain waves and activity, with the camera in front, on your forehead! :d
have you tried the whoop?
that galaxy smart ring is not worth buying because it has no nfc tap and pay. when samsung adds nfc tap and pay to the galaxy smart ring, only then will i may or may not consider buying it.
valuable insight on your health, sleep, and energy levels.  all bs that nobody gives a crap about.  this is just another way to track you 24/7, and gleam more data, which the government will also use.
so it&#39;s not even accurate? for anyone who has a smart watch, i see no point. unless you&#39;re going to get rid of your watch or you don&#39;t have one.
smart rings might be a cool idea, but the current feature set does not warrant the price they put on it.
there&#39;s a market of people who buy this and have zero intention of wearing it for anything other than sleep tracking, it&#39;d be cool to have heard more about that..<br><br>p.s. oura rings give you absolutely no information if you don&#39;t pay the monthly subscription
i have a fitbit charge 5 and i love it. it&#39;s not the best smartwatch by a mile, but it has a week long battery life!
sometimes my watch i take off gives me false readings like it thinks i have it on and it detects 190 pulse i was freaking out when i put it back on because i got the notification&#39;s but noticed it was hours ago when i took it off. galaxy watch 4
what if marques was a tech ceo ?
samsung says it works with any phone that supports samsung health app - which is most of them.
so its a galaxy watch with fewer features?
issa gonna be a no for me dawg
apple will do it right and release theirs in 5 years time
it also has to be a galaxy phone with android 11 or greater!   it does not work on a older note 9 or 10.
the pricing on these is terrible and i expect these to be doa. these shouldve been under 100-200$.
jeweler here: there&#39;s a size difference between your left and right hand, depending on which hand is your dominant hand. the difference can range between half a size to a full size!!! maybe that&#39;s where you made the mistake
insane price for something of this size..
another tracker lol
informative!!
ring has find ring function !! what review is this? you said don t have
seems like instead of a ring they should make a bracelet, that tracks from under the wrist. more accurate, will work fir pretty much any sport and less likely to fall off and get lost
you should do a whoop review!
very overpriced for a minescuale amount of sensors
i want eightsleep so bad but even with the discount it&#39;s still sooo incredibly expensive. we need some competition.
guess i&#39;m waiting till next gen
i hate the fact that the size kit isn&#39;t free it should be free
i&#39;m not buying anything half useful but can&#39;t be repaired and lock me into any brand.
so the motion for photos isn&#39;t very common in the us but almost every other country i travel too will use the hand motion on their android phone to take selfies. most recently during my latam exploration trip almost all people were doing it instead of selfie sticks. just goes to show how quickly things change once you leave the us.
i had this idea of this type of ring 25 years ago. i guess our thoughts are somehow all connected.
dumb product.
four<br><br>hundred<br><br>dollars!?<br><br>gtfo of here!
this isn&#39;t satire...
the ultrahuman ring does not have a subscription
i looked at other reviews and only yours seems to be negative. now i am wondering whether your experience is outlier or whether others didn&#39;t test it properly
eight sleep requiring a subscription. no way
fyi: if you use it in conjunction with galaxy watch, then you&#39;ll get an overall better / more accurate reading in your health application as they compliment each other.
when you gonna respond to louis rossman?
a smart mattress cover? what the actual fuck?
awesome intro<br>great idea, pretty good execution <br>not working with all android phones is a big disadvantage
just came back to this channel after a couple of years and holy am i blown away by the production quality. that intro was phenomenal
once apple launches a smart ring he will be like ohh my its magical..... mkbhd has become just an isheep
400$ for this?
i lost a ring once.  watches seem safer, i&#39;ll stick to them.  (thanks for the review...)
i love the new samsung ring its so much better than the aura ring which costs a damn subscription and works seamlessly with the samsung ecosystem great review marques
oura user of 3+ years here, i havent tried the samsung ring, but the oura ring has been very accurate when it comes to detecting when i am sleeping. havent bumped into the issue where it lagged a few hours behind. kudos to oura&#39;s algo
thank you for an honest useful review. i have the ring and came to the same conclusions. sending back. not useful!
that it showed that the wooden hand does indeed have a pulse is nothing to worry about. just don&#39;t think about it. it is fine.
out. the less i know the better.
sounds like the feedback is samsung should make a smart bracelet.
title should have been, samsung galaxy ring review: i wanted to make it my precious!
i think something like a bracelet is the best thing.
how about integrating all the functionality of the ring in the bands of watch itself, won&#39;t it eliminate the need for ring altogether and it might even be more accurate than the ring.
thanks for the review
i wear weight training gloves over my wedding ring. this works fine, did you try this?
smart rings just seem like the next pointless tech to sell people
id&#39;s just like a smartwatch that would show notifications and had some useful features like weather or alarms or payments but would last at least two weeks without a charge. i don&#39;t need any fitness tracking really. and i definetly don&#39;t need a tiny version of my smartphone on my wrist that i have to charge every day, like why. i just refuse to believe that there is so many hardcore fitness nerds that would be buying these. also what is a purpose of a ring that measures only fitness info and nothing else and probably not well enough for most fitness nerds. weird stuff.
to me, the smart ring is mostly about sleep tracking with some extra activity info on occasion. i wouldn&#39;t rely on just a ring to track my runs. that&#39;s what i have a garmin watch for. samsung&#39;s ring looks nice, but they need to fix the accuracy stuff though. and i really hope they don&#39;t start charging a subscription.
i keep my (very thick) ring on when i do such activities. that said. i have years of ring wearing. you get used to it.
the moment apple releases a smart ring, then all these &quot;influencers&quot; gonna praise the product. sorry but it is a bad review.
pinky would be best for a ring
like you, the ring is not for me. interesting review. thank you.
hm.. how about smart ear jewelry?
seems like lord of the rings
ultimate frisbee mentioned lets gooooooooooo
honestly when you go to the hospital when they take your pulse they measure it on the index finger, so the finger being the preferred measuring spot
ultimate frisbee?  didn&#39;t know you played.  i play too, so thanks for that perspective i was thinking about getting one - thought could keep the ring on during.  always great reviews. thanks.
can i clean my shit while wearing this?
i dont really know if thats different in germany, but we dont need a samsung phone for sure. i had it different in mind and checked it 3 mins ago, you need android + the samsung health app out of the play store. i think this is one of the most important things to know, when you dont have an samsung, google, huawei with an seperate smartwatch you might consider getting the ring!
that ad for 8sleep really felt like it was just word-for-word what the company told him to say
marquessss your vids are out of control!!! loving it
not such a good idea for fatty fingers
this just shows how incredibly far ahead the oura ring is from any competition
went straight into the sleep ad. smoooth!
why isn&#39;t there a sensor to check your ring finger size?
the simplest idea to get fans and nerds to buy these samsung rings is to create tolkien&#39;s lord of the rings smart ring. they will be flocking to buy them like hot cakes. lol.
i thought it was going to be more than a physical activity tracker 400$? nah son
fitbit mentions to turn it on the inside of the wrist for best heart rate during intense workouts or biking. long time ago.
well now they have a ton of data to analyze...i expect that the readings will improve very quickly
i want uwb support so i can use ring as car key
wanted it, but hard pass since the data isnt reliable. like, its one job is to output data so idk how this gets released when it can&#39;t do that even remotely accurately
&quot;ive never worn a ring before&quot;. in other words, &quot;ladies hmu&quot;
such an awful research on your videos. how can 20 people not find a true spec?
could you put tape around the ring for your important workout activities - and would it work? i see footballers (the foot one not the hand one) do that
i bought the size kit and it&#39;s states on the box that you can choose any finger. it doesn&#39;t have to be your index.
i don&#39;t see any benefit of this at all.  it&#39;s useless. i don&#39;t care about tracking a single thing this thing does.
thank you for making a technical device understandable for everyone. most techie device vids use jargon and techie talk as if everyone knows exactly what they are talking about. you&#39;ve also given reasons why people would want the product. thanks!
a bed subscription service has to be the craziest thing i have ever fucking seen.
yo marques - why didnt we get the visual of your &quot;weight-lifting&quot; - do you even lift bro!! <br>lol
the takeaway here, don&#39;t buy anything from eight sleep, they require a subscription for a mattress cover.
- only works with samsung galaxy <br>- can&#39;t wear it during many workout types <br>- tracks your heart rate when it&#39;s not even on, indicating that it&#39;s just making it up <br>- doubles your step count<br>- doesn&#39;t track floors climbed and other stuff <br><br>sounds like this is just ewaste trash like the humane pin and the rabbit r1
did you try to pair it to a non samsung phone?
seems like the ring n watch together could be a really good combo
what i really want from a &quot;smart ring&quot; is to get notification buzzes and have a speaker and microphone so i can respond to calls
the smasung ring is too small!  went into the samsung shop this morning and checked out the ring to discover that i won&#39;t be buying one as the biggest ring is too small! i wonder who did the market sizing and collated the antrophrometric data!! i doubt that i will be the only person not buying it.
great videos like always lad. few versions/models in, it&#39;ll be really good.
you are not lifting heavy enough if you use smartwatch instead of lifting straps )
wow the intro was good
even if samsung wrote on their website that only samsung phones are supported, why didnt you definitively try to test it yourself with some other android phone brand?
would have been nice to show what the ring actually does. what the 3 sensors do and how the software looks. can it do more than watching heartbeat and sleep? what does the software do with the data? does samsung have something like a health app like apple does?
can i use this for my engagement ring? lolol
hey crazy idea... why not make a wristband instead solves all your problems.
i read qn article today where the author said they had it paired to the xiaomi phone they were using but they had to download the samsung health app.
i&#39;ll wait second gen then
what i&#39;m wondering is if there is any benefit to wearing a galaxy watch and ring at the same time. basically, does samsung have a marketing strategy to sell both products to the same person, rather than one or the other?
was all set to get one but you mentioned it doesn&#39;t vibrate, no thanks
good review here.<br><br>it seems we need a wristband tracker that&#39;s smaller than the smart watch so people don&#39;t have to worry about taking a ring off
right &quot;phantom heart reading 10pm&quot; lol
i don&#39;t like samsung
i think a good compromise on the exclusive functions would be making it free for samsung phone users but allow it to also work for other brands and just charge a fee. ideally a one time fee, but of course everyone wants the subscription $
tbh, it looks pretty uncomfortable, too thick.
let us know when 8 sleep makes a product that doesn&#39;t cost infinite amounts of money, everyone could benefit from better sleep, but only bohemian grove members can comfortably afford 8 sleep
if it cant tell you were asleep til later in your sleep...is it possible it measures something within rem sleep? since it takes longer to enter rem? no sure how these kinds of things can tell when you are asleep
bruh, i saw you in beast&#39;s videos.
been using the oura gen 3 heritage ring for almost 2 years now, almost every day, this garbage from samsung does not even compare.
watching mkbhd after 4 days of internet blockade in country. this feels nice.
the rings are cool, but dont work for indoor / outdoor climbing. i am not aware of any activties that a watch interferes with, but the ring just doesn&#39;t mesh with certain sports.
for those who want a device to show them a number of steps they probably haven&#39;t walked, a heartrate that is reasonable for a person probably, maybe it&#39;s even near their heartrate, and a number of calories that would probably be nice to burn, but it&#39;s probably not in the range of what they burned.
i like the idea, because when i run on treadmill i dont wanna feel of something around my hand like watch etc. but to buy new galaxy to get that, its too much of an investion.
im glad you answered about the workout activities. that was my biggest concern and one of thebonly reasons i want a watch or ring.  think ill just get a watch
what if u wear it on ur toes?<br>wont interfere with ur exercise
he is secretly so fond of the ring that he made up a story about loosing it and can &quot;unfortunately&quot; not return it to samsung ;-)
$399 for an inaccurate ring that gets in the way of using your hands. true un-novation.
battery life?
so basically, it&#39;s trash. not gonna buy it.
samsung never fails to invent an useless thing that doesn&#39;t work :d
i heard the eightsleep leaks and breaks for a lot of people. how long and what generation is yours
oneplus pad 2 review???
that apple stimulus check coming in strong clearly
i&#39;m not gonna buy this although i&#39;m sammy boy. good advice never buy first gen products. i&#39;m going to wait for gen 4  it&#39;s usually the best. what i need is a small led on this ring which shows me an hour and steps i did. that&#39;s gonna be a ring i&#39;m gonna buy
the ring and the watch do not measure together, only one will measure at a time to save battery of the other device. then you use the samsung health app for the consolidated results, i think that&#39;s why you have steps/staircase discrepancy in your review.
is there anything non apple that you like?
he is looking cool with beared
get off my algorithm reggin
review ola maps for india....
yeah the ring sounds cool and all, but a watch is much better for usage for me.
certified landfill
surface laptop review coming?? i caught the black laptop 7 in the intro ;)
if this was $75, maybe. but it costs more than the samsung watch 7
not surprised though. samsung always lacks quality. this product was obviously designed just to be different from apple after they&#39;ve been copying products after products from them. apple is not that great but they surely know what they are doing. they design things that solve particular problems. that&#39;s why apple products has always become part of our lives(airpods, watches) but this galaxy ring thing isn&#39;t gonna take off.
uhm. god i was hoping this was an old april fools day post.
no nfc is lame
marques&#39;s voice always just puts a smile on my face
siccc intro.
i think this will appeal to older people who want the health information without having a smart watch and not needing to charge it too frequently
corporate shill
does it unlock a tesla?
this thing should not cost more than $100 for what it does.
honestly who would wear this
the back of the wrist might not be the best place for optical heart rate sensors but the index finger is even worse.  all of these ring companies try to sell us on the fact that the index finger is a good location but there aren&#39;t any creditable studies (non-sponsored studies) backing up that marketing claim.  generally speaking, the farther away from the body&#39;s extremities the better: upper arm, temple or places that move and shake less are more ideal.
how does this ring compare with others on the market?
pixel watch 2 is the best money to accurate readings so i would much rather have that
garmin pls come fix this segment
isn&#39;t this ring like 400 bucks? <br><br>samsung has lost their minds if they think this ring will sell good. <br><br>if they dont reduce the price, i can see them discontinuing this product.
dude wears the ring on his index finger and his watch on his right arm<br>can&#39;t take this guy seriously
have you every combined your two favourite activities and done disc golf?
fly! you fools!!
we have to wear this on our pointer finger? what does samsung think we all play dungeons and dragons?
it isn&#39;t really ai if it only gives you data, i expected a ring you can talk to to do stuff with your phone
oura ring - august 18th 2015<br><br>john mclear&#39;s nfc ring kickstarter - july 20 2013. the first guy to do the materials science behind it iirc.<br><br>obviously there&#39;s much more that goes into the oura ring, but just wanted to point to the predecessors that scaled the mountain bare-handed in le olden times.
might flop..tbh. a fitbit is cheaper and people hardly wear that. i see something else
seems like smart bracelets (like a fitbit) may be the way to go. long battery life, no distracting screen, out of the way of fingers.
my precioussss
if the back of the wrist is so bad for measuring vitals, why don&#39;t the smart watch companies just put a sensor in the band. i&#39;m sure it&#39;s not beyond the wit of these companies to design a band that would place the sensors in the correct position
you should review whoop band
not to bad of a gadget
bro apple may launch iphone se 4 they may give 48mp single camera but with lidar is so much better it doesn&#39;t affect the cost and kindly advise apple to place the action button (ai button) in near to power button it will give a symmetry feel with volume button your request must reach apple like the type c it must
this is why i prefer samsung over apple. they innovate and are constantly making new things. apple just adds a new camera. the vision pro is just an ipad you wear on your face
so, you would pay money for something that tracks your every move? sounds like an enslavement ring. or bracelet, if it&#39;s a watch or fitness band. but hey, it&#39;s a wireless chain! um.
can you wear the ring on your toes if you can&#39;t have it on you fingers?
at what point do we go &quot;yeah, we tried but this tech just doesn&#39;t work yet&quot;? like he said in the review, this product is new, but similar products have been on sale for years and they all seem to have the same issues with inaccuracy. maybe it&#39;s not a samsung problem, but a smart ring problem?
those days are near when couples will marry with this ring
the heart rate was continueing cus the hand was alive
soo do you have any video to investigate what smartphones that will be good for senior people to use ? what is complicated and what is more easy for seniors to use ? samsung samsung s24 ultra with pen for more economical use, or google pixel easy operative system. iphone ? <br>top of this, what phone is good good together with smart systems like google or alexa, siri?
this one feels another one like how to kill a product with a review.
i wear rings all the time, fingers get swollen with heat. so in summer i have to wear my rings on smaller fingers (the winter index is a summer medium etc). i don&#39;t think this can be completely solved - i guess with a size adapter on the top part of the ring when needed?
it doubles the steps and miles, doesn&#39;t track sleep when you&#39;re sleeping, measures heart rate for hours even though you didn&#39;t wear the ring.<br>sorry this product obviously does not work. marques, why so soft to samsung? an honest review would highlight the fact that this is actually completely useless.
i wear a garmin epix on my ankle, you get more accurate hr than wrist and it isn&#39;t in the way
as someone who doesn&#39;t like watches at all, would love to see a comparison of accuracy between the ring and just the phone for steps.
yep, rings are dumb.
given samsungs past history of lying to customers about their products capabilities . i wont be surprised if they are doing something deceptive again.
as you mentioned, in the health field, it&#39;s known that you get far better readings on the index finger than you would on the wrist. is it possible the ring is actually picking up more activity because of this? it would make sense why the readings between the watch and the ring seem inconsistent. <br><br>as far the ring still reading and being active i think it may need time to adjust to the user but that&#39;s just a baseless guess.
i would like to have a small touch sensor on the side of the ring towards my thumb. so i can, tap to pause/play, swipe along the ring to increase or decrease volume, maybe doubletap to skip and trriple to gffo back. like an inear but at your hand
the heart rates when he wasn&#39;t even wearing it is all you need to know. shit doesnt work. dont buy it.
tracker would be a good idea.
it&#39;s not only the ring miscounting steps but the whole samsung health software. i have samsung health, google fit, and huawei health. i have installed both health apps on my two phones and for whatever reason samsung counts steps in a moving vehicle, while on a motorbike and riding a bicycle. google fit and huawei won&#39;t. <br>samsung needs to fix this.
love the intro video! high quality stuff
is that intro from disney ? it looked awesome
i wonder if there&#39;s anything like a &quot;smart band&quot; which has all the features the ring has but without the cons of it + cheaper and less annoying than a smartwatch
i&#39;ve worn a wedding ring every day for 11 years in my marriage
really need a review for the surface
well u should do this with comparison to other smart rings.. the issue u mentioned isn&#39;t in the ultrahuman ring. but since i don&#39;t have a watch i cannot compare the data. i do believe that not able to wear this when u are doing work is really a minus. weekends where i&#39;m doing something from my hands all the time and it is just useless
what has lions and snakes got to do with frisbee? is this an s.o.s. sign?
damn that intro was r e a l l y cool :dd!
shill
when did you sell your soul to apple ?
i think we should take a moment, and appreciate, man! - where we have reached, clubbing that amount of stuff and tech in that ring size, it&#39;s crazy innovation, and i feel this would get better overtime.
my samsung watch records my footsets with accuracy.
it should measure actual sleep, not relaxing in bed.
would love to see you reviewing the ultrahuman air ring or maybe compare it with samsung and oura?
you should take a look at the colmi r06 smart ring. it&#39;s around 20 bucks and has the same features as the samsung one.
that is a pretty fair review. the step counting seems a bit concerning
can you do the dyson ontrac headphone review?
u should review the galaxy watch fe.
the ring on your index finger just looks wrong for some reason.
im gonna get samsung  galaxy watch fe instead.
being a ring wearer. rings turn on the finger. do you have to continually make sure the sensors are at the bottom?
great video
nfc would have been awesome
mind blowing introooo!!!<a href="uckszu2wh9gy1mb0dv-11ujg/dfgfy9landmmq7ipui2aaa"></a>
instead of fitness tracker, this should be a spying device
explaining how you trust the watch is well thought out.
you should make a review for the whoop, i&#39;ve hears great things but they have warned me that it takes at least a few weeks (or even months) for it to adapt to you. would love to hear your opinion!
it&#39;s crazy to watch this review of mkbhds, i remember when he wasn&#39;t clearly being paid by apple and gave honest reviews
missed opportunity for the that ring to have the language of mordor on it
now we have started monitoring everything! it is good in many ways but, surely it increases mircostress levels as we keep checking numbers and trying to reach them. in earlier days, people remain stress-free without checking any numbers. nowadays people compete like who walked more steps which is a good exercise but at the same time they are taking stress of competing, so there should be a limit to such metrics. heart rate monitor is good, bp monitor but why do we need to check sleep details. when we wake up, we exactly know how we slept. just a bunch of useless products to make money. :)
i find the idea of both a smart ring and a smart mattress silly
do they make one that&#39;s about 3 inches wide?
x provided by x for review.
android is a lesser product and shouldn&#39;t be counted on for anything at all.  android is the dodge of the tech world.  gimmicky and unreliable.
the ring is an interesting concept and wonder what upgrades or new features will be added. i never get the 1st of anything i&#39;ll be interested in maybe 2nd or 3rd
good little ad time length indicator, good work there.
this does explain why it wasnt released in aus lmfao, accc wouldve had a field day
lol mkbhd if it was apple you would be gargling their pr bs all video long... anyway have a great day.
i feel like married people will buy this the most.
i miss the ms band. the sensors would go on the inside of your wrist.
marques your shirt/jersey is cool how can i get one to buy?
try whoop and oura ring!
marques do u remember collin from high school well he is getting married
you could just mention the price and 99.9% of ppl would steer clear
everything from samsung works like college capstone project
i still sized mine for my ring finger. it&#39;s too uncomfortable on the index finger.
intro felt like a commercial.<br>the graphics team deserve a raise.<br>soundtrack was sweet as well
week long battery is awesome i stop wearing a smart watch because i didnt want to charge it everyday
pass.
i think that only ring on the index finger looks really strange.
by one of correct size for you and then comlain about wrong sensors readings.
tech peaked
this video really, really should have mentioned the whoop
cancel.. i am not going to buy! :))
because fitness trackers are getting smaller, i can almost guarantee that we&#39;ll have fitness chips in our bodies in 5-7 years. they&#39;ll sell it as &quot;convenience&quot; and less than $4,500 usd for the second gen (install not included). might buy but i&#39;d need a bionic knee by then
such an useless product
why no basic time stamps?
did this guy ever apologize for shilling for apple?
think you need a size 9 mate
fake video! mkbhd loves it
you would take it off at the gym
the ad is so on spot that i didn&#39;t even consider skipping it
the fact that it continued to show heart readings when you took it off for hours and it showed an almost double number of steps compared to apple watch, those &#39;flaws&#39; alone make me come to the conclusion that i would never invest in such a gadget. i&#39;ve said flaws in quotes because i don&#39;t even believe this is a genuine product; it&#39;s a gimmick, a con, and an insult, and i feel sorry for people who fall for this nonsense and part with their cash. i mean, where did the extra heartbeats and steps come from? anyway, thank you for the review,  i never even knew this kind of bs existed.
i miss no nonsense fitness trackers without screen like fitbit flex.
i think a feature that wouldve really made this stand out, would be a low power time display on the top. with the raise to wake feature so it&#39;s not always on, too.
you lost me at it still shows my heart rate after removing it.
this ring seems like an obvious scam
&quot;i want to love it&quot; seems like a common phrase.
if it lasted a month maybe cus i dont wanna be worring about charging
this is just not a product to sell to consumers. its very in accurate and hardly does its job at all. samsung needs to go back to the drawing board with this and release the complete product
i don&#39;t know if i can trust this guy anymore. he&#39;s been a walking and breathing propaganda for big tech companies. unfollowing and unsubscribing.
apple product works with apple only: cool<br>samsung product works with samsung only: absurd!
3 comments based on my experience with the oura over the last 5 years...<br>1. i hated it when they introduced the monthly fee.  wasn&#39;t there for my first ring, and then when they made me upgrade... surprise.<br>2. the pointer finger shape is not condusive to continual wear as it is tupicaally more conical in shape than the ring finger, which has a bigger knuckle to help secure the ring.<br>3. i couldnt figure out how to sync my oura to the health app i use that comes on  samsung devices. so i went out and got a smartwatch.
since when can you not wear a ring while lifting? power lifter and oura ring owner for years. i take the ring off to box...that&#39;s it.
i know you don&#39;t daily drive one, but i&#39;m disappointed you never mentioned how it is also able to work <b>with</b> a galaxy watch for more accurate readings across both
all i want in a ring is changing music and volume and have an nfc option thats all
will you do a test for the galaxy watch 7?
what&#39;s your response to louis rossman?
review the whoop
nobody needs this.
try the whoop band. you can still wear that playing frisbee/golf with the arm band option. wondering if you will like it or not
i was looking forward to this but it sounds like it sucks
ever since your puff piece for apple, it&#39;s hard not to think if you as nothing more than a paid propagandist.
the ring is not only compatible with samsung phones! i checked the website of the samsung ring and it says thst it is compatible with all android devices v11+. would be nice if you corrected this! :)
&quot;the ring only works with samsung phone.&quot;<br>maybe put this in the beginning so people does not have to waste their ten minutes till you get to this very important point?
het a proper fitting ring before giving a review
personally i think your giving it to much credit.. if it&#39;s not accurate data than it&#39;s a useless item.
you have same thing happening on apple watch and other devices. phantom readings are just algorithm it takes averages and make mistakes. google apple watch(even though it&#39;d the best) and people get measurements of blankets, pillows etc.<br>google: apple watch still measuring heart rate when not wearing +reddit
make video of oneplus nord 4
cant think of anything more annoying than wearing a ring. just aak any newly married guy. you fidget with it all the time
imagine someone proposing with this.
this video was just a considerable amount of rambling. features and benefits seemed to take second place.
in my opinion, to review galaxy wearables, it&#39;s better to stop your samsung phone from collecting activity data. this is to ensure that samsung health accumulates data only from the wearable devices.
put it on your tor :d
can&#39;t wait for lotr collab
finally, intros again. they&#39;ve gotten away from those and it makes me look forward to the videos more and want to see each and every one.
he doesn&#39;t like anything if it&#39;s not from google or apple
an important aspect that you didn&#39;t mention: when paired with a watch, the watch and ring talk to each other directly to get an even more accurate reading. i believe that a ring + watch combo would give you the most accurate readings of any smart wearable.
the o2 sensors in surgery wrap around the index finger
and i thought smartwatches was redundant... now this thing...
monthly subscription from 8sleep would be awful. i always want one but will never buy it because of that.
id much rather just wear a smart watch
tbh, i do wear a smartwatch most of the time. <br><br>for me personally, i&#39;d only get a smartring for when i wanna wear one of my other, non smart watches and get a &quot;blind-spot&quot; in my health monitoring
now that&#39;s the mark of the beast
i can wear my epix pro 2 for two weeks and i never take it out.
running, cycling, kayaking, hiking...just a few ways the ring would be awesome! this dude doesn&#39;t do enough testing in his reviews.
@mkbhd i&#39;m waiting for your video review on microsoft surface laptop :)
i don&#39;t understand the shot of the s24 ultra + galaxy ring + apple watch ultra
apple and samsung need to pull their heads outta their butts. locking features down is really shady.
total control
these gadgets make you think  such gadgets are pretty much crap no utility at all
some men are going to wear this on their &quot;finger&quot;
question -are we gonna get a xperia 1 vi review? or are you not doing it?
i don&#39;t get the point in a ring that is the same cost as a fkin watch with a display and shit lol. if samsung could stop trying to be apple for a bit that would be nice
lol so pay for a ring ther can count your steps let me guess it only cost 500 or 1000 bucks
great video! your new trading strategy seems really interesting. i appreciate the detailed explanation and examples you provided. it&#39;s always exciting to see innovative approaches to trading that can potentially increase profits. i&#39;m definitely going to give it a try and see how it works for me. keep up the great work and thank you for sharing your knowledge with us!
that ring size is clearly to big on his finger
give it a year or 3 and some newer versions before this becomes viable.
incredibly unreliable, what a half baked product lmao. excited for the apple ring
someone really needs to go in depth on how accurate these fitness trackers actually are. for all we know they could just be spitting out random data that isn&#39;t even correct... like seriously, the margin between the apple watch and the ring regarding health data is extremely concerning... not just for the galaxy ring but for all fitness trackers period. i just want someone to expose that non of these &quot;trackers&quot; actually track anything.
that ring seems pretty big on his finger. i can see why it was uncomfortable with exercises but maybe that isn&#39;t the original ring. i think the other cool feature that i have read was that it ties in with the watch and can switch sensors supposedly to help preserve battery life and raises the accuracy. i thought that was pretty neat. it&#39;s a gen 1 device overall so i imagine some live beta testing happening for a good bit.
can you open beers with it?
i&#39;ve found that samsung fitness tracking on their watches and phones is generally higher than actual. no surprise the ring totally overestimates everything.
love my ringconn
i was easily able to grab marques&#39; fingerprint from this video. 4k is pretty scary.
i thought this would solve all of my concerns with fitness gadget (smaller form factor, last longer, etc.), but this is just a slew of problems that i don&#39;t want to have (compatible with samsung phone only, easy to lose, phantom reading etc.)
